          <h3>Zeros of polynomials, from Descartes‘ Rule to P vs. NP</h3>
          <h4>Olga Holtz (TU Berlin, UC Berkeley)</h4>
          <p align="justify">First algebraic methods for zero localization of polynomials go back to Descartes and Newton. But the story does not end there. Instead, it continues till today, leading to a number of recent advances such as the construction of Ramanujan graphs of every degree. I will review its humble beginnings and its rich connections to problems as varied &mdash; and as notorious &mdash; as the Riemann Hypothesis and P vs. NP.</p>

          <h3>Balanced manifolds or how to color a donut</h3>
          <h4>Martina Juhnke-Kubitzke (University of Osnabr&uml;ck)</h4>
          <p align="justify">The enumeration of faces of various types of simplicial complexes is a prominent topic in algebraic, topological and geometric combinatorics. In this talk, I will first provide a short survey on what is known for general simplicial complexes, simplicial polytopes and triangulations of manifolds. In the second part, the focus lies on balanced simplicial complexes, i.e., simplicial complexes whose underlying graph permits a minimal proper coloring in the graph-theoretic sense.</p>

          <h3>Tropical Linear Algebra</h3>
          <h4>Jorge Alberto Olarte (FU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">Tropical geometry is a relatively recent field that studies `polyhedral shadows' of algebraic varieties. In the tropical world there are many objects and theorems which are analogous to those in algebraic geometry. In this talk we will look specifically at tropical linear spaces and compare them with classical linear spaces. The main objective of the talk is to provide the audience with an understanding of what tropical linear spaces are, how do they look like and how do they relate to matroid polytopes. At the end I will briefly mention some results from the research that I have carried out with Alex Fink and with Marta Panizzut and Benjamin Schr&ouml;ter.</p>

          <h3>Counting projective planes</h3>
          <h4>Simona Boyadzhiyska (FU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">
            A finite <i>projective plane</i> is a pair \((\mathcal{P},\mathcal{L})\), where \(\mathcal{P}\) is a finite set of elements, called <i>points</i>, and \(\mathcal{L}\) is a set of subsets of \(\mathcal{P}\), called <i>lines</i>, satisfying the following axioms:
          </p><ol>
              <li>For any distinct \(p_1, p_2\in\mathcal{P}\), there is a unique \(\ell\in\mathcal{L}\) such that \(p_1,p_2\in\ell\).</li>
              <li>For any distinct \(\ell_1,\ell_2\in\mathcal{L}\), we have \(|\ell_1\cap\ell_2| = 1\).</li>
              <li>There exists a set of four points, no three of which belong to the same line.</li>
          </ol><p align="justify">
            It can be shown that if \((\mathcal{P},\mathcal{L})\) is a finite projective plane, then there exists a number \(n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}\), called the <i>order</i> of the projective plane, such that any point is contained in exactly \(n+1\) lines, \(|\ell| = n+1\) for any \(\ell\in\mathcal{L}\), and \(|\mathcal{P}| = |\mathcal{L}| = n^2+n+1\).
          </p><p align="justify">
            Finite projective planes have been studied extensively, and yet some of the simplest and most natural questions related to them remain open or only partially answered. The first example of such a question is, given an integer \(n\), does there exist a projective plane of order \(n\)? Perhaps surprisingly, for many values of \(n\) the answer is still unknown.
          </p><p align="justify">
            Another interesting question we could ask is, what is the number of pairwise non-isomorphic projective planes of order \(n\)? In this talk, we will discuss some of the known results in this direction; in particular, we will see asymptotic lower and upper bounds on this number.
          </p>

          <h3>Hollow polytopes of large width</h3>
          <h4>Giulia Codenotti (FU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">The aim of this talk is to present the construction of lattice polytopes of width larger than their dimension. After introducing lattice polytopes and some of their properties, such as width and hollowness, I will show how taking a direct sum of certain polytopes yields a hollow lattice polytope (resp.\ a hollow lattice simplex) of dimension \(14\) (resp.\(404\)) and of width \(15\) (resp. \(~408\)). They are the first known hollow lattice polytopes of width larger than dimension. Asymptotic results can also be proved with this method, and will be touched upon if time allows. All terms introduced here (and more!) will be defined during the talk.</p>

          <h3>Grids of quadrilaterals with touching inscribed conics</h3>
          <h4>Alexander Fairley (FU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">Conics are classical mathematical objects that have engendered many theorems. I will talk about a few theorems on the projective geometry of inscribed conics. In particular, I will present a theorem about grids of quadrilaterals with touching inscribed conics. Throughout the talk, there will be many illustrative computer graphics. At the end of the talk, I will mention current research about nets of planar quadrilaterals with touching inscribed conics.</p>

          <h3>Port-Hamiltonian systems</h3>
          <h4>Candan G&uuml;d&uuml;c&uuml; (TU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">The framework of port-Hamiltonian systems (PH systems) combines both the Hamiltonian approach and the network approach, by associating with the interconnection structure of the network model a geometric structure given by a Dirac structure. Furthermore, port-Hamiltonian systems theory is ideally suited for a systematic mathematical treatment of multi-physics systems by using energy and power as the lingua franca between different physical domains. A numerical method that exploits the structure of PH systems by using additive splitting methods has been derived. The results from a series of parametrized numerical experiments are presented to show the numerical stability and behavior of the solution depending on the parameters.</p>

          <h3>Exponential loss of memory for the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with small noise</h3>
          <h4>Tom Klose (TU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">
            We study the stochastic ordinary differential equation (SODE)
              $$\begin{equation}
                \dot{u}_{\varepsilon}(t) = -\nabla U(u_{\varepsilon}(t)) + \varepsilon\dot{w}(t), \quad
                  			u_{\varepsilon}(0) \in B(\pm 1,\delta),
                  			\label{eq:sde}\tag{AC}
                  		\end{equation}$$
            which is started in a small \(\delta\)-ball around \(+1\) or \(-1\), the stable equilibria of the <i>double-well potential</i> \(U(z) = \frac{1}{4}z^4 - \frac{1}{2} z^2\):

            </figure>
          </p><p align="justify">
          	Under the presence of a temporal white noise \(\dot{w}\) with small intensity \(\varepsilon> 0\), solutions to (AC) exhibit <i>metastable</i> behaviour: they &bdquo;jump&ldquo; between neighbourhoods of \(+1\) and \(-1\) (Figure b), a phenomenon completely different from deterministic dynamics (Figure a).
              <table style="width:100%">

          	Started from two different initial conditions \(u_{\varepsilon,1}(0), u_{\varepsilon, 2}(0) \in B(\pm 1, \delta)\), however, solutions to (AC) (in case \(\varepsilon >0\)) couple asymptotically with high probability: under the same random evolution, the equation &bdquo; loses memory&ldquo; of its initial condition exponentially fast.
          </p><p align="justify">
          	I will make the preceding statement precise and outline the strategy of proof. Time permitting, I will discuss how the recent breakthrough in the study of singular stochastic <i>partial</i> differential equations (SPDE) allows to &bdquo;tame infinities&ldquo; (Martin Hairer, Fields Medal 2014) using renormalisation techniques. We are then able to tackle the exponential loss of memory for the dynamic \(\Phi^4_3\) model <i>formally</i> given by the non-linear SPDE
            $$\begin{equation}
          	 (\partial_t - \Delta) \Phi_{\varepsilon}(t,x) = -\nabla U(\Phi_{\varepsilon}(t,x))+ \varepsilon\xi(t,x), \quad (t,x) \in \mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{T}^3,
          		\tag{\(\Phi^4_3\)}
          	\end{equation}$$
          	which describes phase separation phenomena in statistical physics and serves as a toy model for Euclidean quantum field theory.

            <h3>Convexity and curvature</h3>
            <h4>Stephen Lynch (FU Berlin)</h4>
            <p align="justify">One need not distinguish between convexity and positive curvature in the case of compact hypersurfaces in Euclidean space &mdash; the two notions are equivalent. This freedom of perspective is useful not only because convexity is a completely extrinsic condition, and the curvature completely intrinsic. Moving from hypersurfaces to submanifolds of higher codimension, Jordan abandons us, and convexity no longer makes sense. In the talk, we will consider an extrinsic 'pinching' condition for submanifolds of Euclidean space which generalises convexity in at least two ways: firstly, it forces positivity of the curvature, and secondly, pinched solutions to the mean curvature flow behave exactly like convex solutions. </p>

            <h3>Cutting a part from many measures</h3>
            <h4>Nevena Pali&#263; (FU Berlin)</h4>
            <p align="justify">Measure partitions are challenging problems in topological combinatorics. Given a collection of measures in a Euclidean space, the question is whether there exists a partition of the ambient space, such that it cuts the measures in a prescribed way. One of the best known measure partition results is the Ham Sandwich theorem proved by Banach in 1938, that states that any collection of \(d\) measures in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) can be cut by a hyperplane, so that each measure gets partitioned into two equal parts.
            </p><p align="justify">In this talk a short survey of measure partition results will be presented and some methods from topological combinatorics will be explained on the example of the paper <i>Cutting a part from many measures</i>, arXiv:1710.05118.
            </p><p align="justify">We prove a continuous analogue of the conjecture of Holmsen, Kyn&ccaron;l and Valculescu about partitions of finite colored sets. Indeed, for integers \(m, c\) and \(d\) and a prime power \(n=p^k\) such that \(d \geq 2\) and \(m \geq n(c-d)+\frac{dn}{p}-\frac{n}{p}+1\), and for \(m\) positive finite absolutely continuous measures \(\mu_1, \dots, \mu_m\) on \(\mathbb{R}^d\), we prove that there exists a partition of \(\mathbb{R}^d\) into \(n\) convex sets, such that every set has positive measure with respect to at least \(c\) of the measures \(\mu_1, \dots, \mu_m\). Additionally, we obtain an equipartition of the measure \(\mu_m\).
            </p><p align="justify">The proof relies on a configuration space/test map scheme that will be the main part of this talk. It translates the problem into a novel question from equivariant topology -- a non-existence of \(\mathfrak{S}_n\)-equivariant maps from the ordered configuration space of \(n\) points in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) into the union of an arrangement of affine subspaces of a Euclidean space.

            <h3>KPZ Equation</h3>
            <h4>Tommaso Cornelis Rosati (HU Berlin)</h4>
            <p align="justify">In 1986, the three physicists Mehran Kardar, Giorgio Parisi, and Yi-Cheng Zhang derived a stochastic partial differential equation whose solution describes the fluctuations of the boundary separating two competing materials. This model found a wide range of applications, from describing the expansion of a forest fire to the interface separating water from ice. Recently there has been an increasing interest in the KPZ equation, since it partially motivated the development of the theory of regularity structures, which aims at tackling certain classes of ill-posed stochastic PDEs. Surprisingly, this solution theory dives deep in the field of stochastic analysis, providing new ways to understand the stochastic integral, a central object in probability theory. I will present one (or maybe two) ideas behind this theory, show some pictures referring to the KPZ equation and very briefly explain my work, namely the construction of a solution on the whole real line.</p>

            <h3>The Moving Least Squares Approach in Point Cloud Processing</h3>
            <h4>Martin Skrodzki (FU Berlin)</h4>
            <p align="justify">The <i>Moving Least Squares</i> (MLS) approach is a powerful means to operate on point clouds. It has been investigated in great detail by David Levin in several papers and was already put to use in geometry processing and shape modeling. The goal of this talk is to briefly give an introduction to the MLS procedure and to report on some recent developments and applications of the method in the field of Point Cloud Processing.</p>

            <h3>On the Hamilton-Jacobi-Equation</h3>
            <h4>Artur Stephan (HU Berlin)</h4>
            <p align="justify">In this talk, we derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Equation
              $$\begin{align*}
              0 &= \frac{\partial}{\partial t}S(x,t) + \mathbf{H}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}S(x,t), x \right)\\
              S(x,0) &= S_0(x),
              \end{align*}$$
            which describes the evolution of the action \(S\) of a physical system governed by the Hamiltonian \(\mathbf{H}\).
            This nonlinear first-order partial differential equation is fundamental in classical physics and has many applications in calculus of variation and geometry. Using methods from convex analysis, we present the fascinating method of E. Hopf for solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Equation in the potential free case.</p>

            <h3>A Gibbsian model for message routing in highly dense wireless networks</h3>
            <h4>Andr&aacutes T&oacutebi&aacutes (TU Berlin)</h4>
            <p align="justify">In spatial telecommunication networks, it is a prominent question how to route many messages in the same time. We propose a random mechanism to choose the trajectories of messages in a network, where users are situated randomly in a compact subset of \(\mathbb R^d\), and each user sends one message to the single base station. Messages are transmitted either directly or via other users, with a given upper bound on the number of hops. We define a Gibbsian probability measure on the set of such trajectory families, which favours trajectories with little interference (measured in terms of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)) and trajectory families with little congestion (measured in terms of the number of pairs of incoming messages of the users).
            </p><p align="align">
              We derive the behaviour of this system in the limit of a high spatial density of users using a large-deviation analysis, and provide a law of large numbers for the empirical measure of message trajectories. The limit of these empirical measures is given as the minimizer(s) of a characteristic variational formula. In the special case when congestion is not penalized, we analyze this minimizer and investigate the questions of the typical number of hops, the typical length of a hop and the typical shape of a trajectory in the highly dense telecommunication system.

            <h3>The Niyogi-Smale-Weinberger Approximation Theorem</h3>
            <h4>Josu&eacute Tonelli-Cueto (TU Berlin)</h4>
            <p align="justify">
              At the end of the 19th century, the artists Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed the technique of pointillism, which is based in the idea that a continuous shape can be represented by a discrete cloud of points. This principle, which is the foundation of all screens, was incorporated almost a century later to what is known as Topological Data Analysis. However, how good can a cloud of points approximate a geometric object?
            </p><p align="align">
              In this talk, we will review the Niyogi-Smale-Weinberger Approximation Theorem which relates how difficult is to approximate topologically a geometric object by a cloud of points to the geometric quantity known as reach.

            <h3>Modified equations and \(\displaystyle \frac{\pi^2}{6}\)</h3>
            <h4>Mats Vermeeren (TU Berlin)</h4>
            <p align="justify">Numerical discretizations of differential equations are often studied through their modified equation. This is a differential equation, usually obtained as a power series, with solutions that exactly interpolate the discretization. By comparing the modified equation to the original equation, the error propagation of the numerical method can be studied.

              When we consider a very simple discrete dynamical system &mdash; one which we can solve exactly &mdash; we can reverse the direction of the argument and use the discrete dynamics to understand the power series defining the modified equation. We use this method to derive the series expansion
              $$ \left( \arcsin \frac{h}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(k-1)!^2}{(2k)!} h^{2k}, $$
              which can be used to prove the well-known identity
              $$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}= \frac{\pi^2}{6} . $$</p>
