          <h3 id="Boyadzhiyska">Minimum degrees of minimal Ramsey graphs</h3>
          <h4>Simona Boyadzhiyska (FU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">A graph \(G\) is Ramsey for another graph \(H\) if any red/blue-coloring of the
           edges of \(G\) contains a monochromatic copy of \(H\). A classical result due to
           Ramsey shows that Ramsey graphs exist for any choice of \(H\). Once we know
           that Ramsey graphs for \(H\) exist, it is natural to ask what such graphs look
           like and what properties they must satisfy. For instance, if you have taken
           a basic course in combinatorics, you might be familiar with the problem of
           determining the Ramsey number of a graph \(H\), which in this language can
           be defined as the minimum number of vertices in a graph that is Ramsey for
           \(H\).
         </p><p align="justify">
           In this talk, we will give a short introduction to the study of (minimal)
           Ramsey graphs, focusing on questions related to minimum degrees. We will
           mainly discuss classical results, aiming to illustrate some of the ideas and
           methods used in this field.
         </p>


          <h3 id="LopezNieto">The Poincaré-Bendixson theorem in delay differential equations</h3>
          <h4>Alejandro Lopez Nieto (FU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">The Poincaré-Bendixson theorem for ordinary differential equations on the plane is 
            one of the most iconic results in dynamical systems theory. The core idea is that the long term behavior 
            of the solution curves is heavily constrained by the \(2\)-dimensional phase space.
          </p><p align="justify">
          Surprisingly, Mallet-Paret and Sell (1) have drawn analogous conclusions for delay differential equations 
          with monotone feedback, for which the phase space is infinite-dimensional.
        </p><p align="justify">
          In the talk I will comment on the results in (1). As an application, we characterize the, genuinely 
          infinite-dimensional, periodic solutions of a particular delay differential equation in terms of a planar 
          ordinary differential equation.
        </p>


          <h3 id="Wei">Geometry of QRT map</h3>
          <h4>Kangning Wei (TU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">QRT map appears in various contexts in mathematical physics and discretizations.
            Geometrically, one obtains a QRT map by composing two involutions defined on a pencil of biquadratic 
            curves on the plane. The QRT map is then a planar birational map with singularities at the base points 
            of the pencil. One can resolve these singularities by blowing up and lifting the QRT map to a surface 
            automorphism. Some dynamical properties can be derived using the help of elliptic surface theory.</p>


          <h3 id="Fairley">Koenigs nets in discrete differential geometry</h3>
          <h4>Alexander Fairley (TU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">At the end of the nineteenth century, Gabriel Koenigs (1858-1931) proved some interesting 
            theorems about conjugate nets with equal Laplace invariants. Nowadays, discrete conjugate nets with equal 
            Laplace invariants are pervasive in discrete differential geometry. In recognition of Gabriel Koenigs' 
            work, they are usually called Koenigs nets. Via the projective geometry of inscribed conics, I will introduce 
            Koenigs nets and I will explain why they can be regarded as a discretisation of conjugate nets with equal 
            Laplace invariants.

          <h3 id="Rehfeldt">Parallel interior-point methods for large-scale linear energy system models</h3>
          <h4>Daniel Rehfeldt (ZIB/TU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">Energy system models are a crucial component of energy system design and operations, 
            as well as energy policy consulting. If detailed enough, such models lead to large-scale linear optimization 
            problems (linear programs, or short LPs) that are intractable even for the best state-of-the-art solvers. This 
            talk describes a new interior-point solver that exploits common structures of energy system LPs to efficiently 
            solve them in parallel on distributed-memory systems.</p><p align="justify">
          In particular, we will describe a preconditioned Schur complement based decomposition approach for 
          solving the linear systems arising within the interior-point algorithm. As a result, energy system LPs with more 
          than one billion variables and constraints can now be solved within two hours.
        </p>


          <h3 id="Levinson">Characteristic classes - who they are?</h3>
          <h4>Tatiana Levinson (FU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">Characteristic classes is a name for a group of cohomological invariants which satisfy 
            certain axioms. In a sense, they measure how much twisted a vector (or, more generally, a principle) bundle is. 
            This is a very powerful tool of Algebraic Topology. For instance, you can use them to prove Hairly ball theorem, 
            which states that you can't draw a continuous non vanishing vector field on a 2-dimensional sphere. You will 
            find characteristic classes in Atiyah–Singer index theorem, one of the most powerful theorems I know, which has 
            application all over the math, from Algebraic Geometry to Mathematical Physics. They are also one of the key 
            tools in modern condensed matter physics.
          </p><p align="justify">
           The goal of my talk is to give you a feeling of what they are and why we care. Don't be scared if you 
          don't understand words in the first two sentences of this abstract - I will give an intuitive explanation, 
          as well as formal definition.
         </p>


          <h3 id="Chaudhuri">Singular limits of the compressible fluid models</h3>
          <h4>Nilasis Chaudhuri (FU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">Compressible fluid models describe a large spectrum of possible models in meteorology, 
            geophysics and astrophysics. The models are given by systems of partial differential equations. Writing 
            these systems in dimensionless form involve characteristic numbers (i.e Mach number, Rossby number, 
            Froude number, Reynolds number etc.). If these numbers are small or large we observe some interesting 
            phenomena. In this talk my aim is to give an idea about this limit behavior.

          <h3 id="Rothgang">Form follows function's flow: what does pouring honey on a lifebuoy have to do with planetary motion?</h3>
          <h4>Michael Rothgang (HU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">I will explain what pouring e.g. honey on a lifebuoy tells you about its topology. It turns 
            out that similar ideas can be applied in a rather different setting, which provides insight into planetary 
            motion. Along the way, we will learn about Morse and Hamiltonian Floer homology and catch a glimpse at how 
            working in symplectic topology can be like.
          </p>


          <h3 id="Padilla">On Bubble Rings and Ink Chandeliers</h3>
          <h4>Marcel Padilla (TU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">Rising air bubbles can roll up into bubble rings with mesmerizing dynamics.
           A drop of ink in water can create a beautiful chandelier like patterns. What
           causes these fluid phenomena and how can you simulate their behavior? In
           this talk a novel model using viscous vortex filaments with buoyancy is presented that accurately recreates 
            real life footage of bubble rings and ink
           chandeliers.

          <h3 id="Hegab">The secret of 27: lines on cubic smooth surfaces.</h3>
          <h4>Fawzy Hegab (TU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">In this talk, we present a classical result on algebraic geometry namely, that every
           smooth cubic surface has exactly 27 lines. Our aim is to introduce the terminologies
           behind this result to non-algebraic geometers and to sketch its proof. The proof of this
           theorem is interesting not only because it presents a justification for a nice result but
           also because it combines important ideas in algebraic geometry like parameter spaces,
           which will appear naturally in the course of the proof. Moreover, for fun, we will give
           evidence for this fact computationally by running a code enumerating them for various
           &ldquo;randomly chosen&rdquo; surfaces.
         </p>


          <h3 id="Grabs">Minimal elastic energy surfaces</h3>
          <h4>Claudia Grabs (Potsdam U)</h4>
          <p align="justify">We use differential geometric methods to deal with the following problem
           coming from continuum mechanics: Consider an elastic membrane, fixed to a
           boundary. By deforming, bending and stretching that boundary, the elastic
           membrane will take shape such a way that the resulting elastic strain energy
           is minimal and the external and internal elastic forces balance out. What do
           these elastic surfaces look like? We look at numerical simulations of rotatio-
           nally symmetric equilibrium shapes as well as compare these to experiments.
           To model different elastic materials, stiff materials or stretchy materials, we
           employ different material laws. Like for minimal surfaces, questions about
           existence, regularity and stability of the elastic surfaces pop up.
         </p>


          <h3 id="Muyesser">Soldiers and Potentials</h3>
          <h4>Alp Müyesser (FU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">It is well-known that in a battlefield, soldiers are placed on \(\mathbb{Z}^2\) and 
            advance by jumping over one another, causing the jumped-over soldier to perish. We introduce the 
            technique of potential functions, and use it to show *many* soldiers are needed to advance more than a 
            couple of coordinates in a battlefield. This shows that wars should be best left as a thought-exercise.
          </p>


          <h3 id="Comaneci">Sums of Squares</h3>
          <h4>Andrei Comăneci (HU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">The relation between sums of squares and non-negativity of polynomials was firstly studied 
            by Hilbert at the end of the \(19^\text{th}\) century and led to the formulation of the \(17^\text{th}\) problem 
            from his celebrated list of problems. This drove to significant developments in real algebraic geometry and,
            more recently, sums of squares were found to be useful in optimization. In this talk, I will present general 
            facts about sums of squares and how they are related to semidefinite programming. In the end, we will see a 
            few applications.
          </p>


          <h3 id="Schroder">Centered colorings for various graph classes</h3>
          <h4>Felix Schröder (TU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">A \(p\)-centered coloring is a vertex-coloring of a graph \(G\) such that for every connected 
            subgraph \(H\) of \(G\) either \(H\) receives more than \(p\) colors or there is a color that appears exactly 
            once in \(H\). The concept was introduced by N&escaron;et&rscaron;il and Ossona de Mendez to provide a local 
            condition suitable to measure sparsity of graphs.
         </p><p align="justify">
           We develop first non-trivial lower bounds on the \(p\)-centered coloring numbers.
           For outerplanar graphs, we prove that their maximum \(p\)-centered coloring number is in \(\Theta(p\log p)\). 
          For planar graphs, we show that some require \(\Omega(p^2 \log(p))\) colors, while all of them admit a 
          \(p\)-centered coloring with \(\mathcal{O}(p^3 \log(p))\) colors. This improves an \(\mathcal{O}(p^{19})\) 
          bound by Pilipczuk and Siebertz. For graphs of degree at most \(\Delta\), we give a coloring with 
          \(\mathcal{O}(\Delta^2 p)\) colors which is in strong contrast to the result for the related weak coloring 
          numbers.

          <h3 id="Stephan">On mathematical coarse-graining for linear reaction systems</h3>
          <h4>Artur Stephan (HU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">In my talk, we consider linear reaction systems (which can also be interpreted as master 
            equations or Kolmogorov forward equations for Markov processes on a finite state space).
            Modeling real-world processes, one often assumes that some reactions are slow and others are fast.
         </p><p align="justify">
            We investigate the limit behavior of the reaction system if the fast reaction
            rates tend to infinity. As we will see, this leads to a coarse-grained
            model on a smaller state space, where the fast reactions create microscopically equilibrated
            clusters, while the exchange mass between the clusters occurs
            on the slow time scale. Interestingly, the whole evolution equation can be reconstructed from the 
          coarse-grained system without loosing any information.
         </p><p align="justify">
            Moreover, one can also show that the coarse-graining and reconstruction procedure does even work on the level of the underlying physical principle (namely the energy-dissipation-principle) and not only for the evolution equation itself. In particular, this justifies the coarse-graining procedure from the physical point of view.
          </p>


          <h3 id="Merino">How to pack objects into a Knapsack?</h3>
          <h4>Arturo Merino (TU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">When trying to fly on an airplane one is given the daunting task of selecting which items 
            to bring along. To make this task easier, for each object \(i\) in your possession, you do the following:
            </p>
         <ul>
           <li> you assign to it a happiness-score \(h_i\) and</li>
           <li> you put it on a scale obtaining it's weight \(w_i\).</li>
         </ul>
         <p align="justify">
           Your plan is to select a subset of items that satisfy the weight restriction of the airline while maximizing 
           happiness. Sadly, even though the problem seems very simple, it is not possible to solve it optimally and 
           efficiently (unless \(\texttt{P}=\texttt{NP}\)). This last observation motivates the search for &ldquo;
           good-enough&rdquo; or approximate solutions that can be found efficiently.
         </p><p align="justify">
           In this talk we will first discuss the traditional Knapsack problem and the methods used to deal with it. 
          Afterwards, we will consider a two-dimensional generalization of the problem. This time the Knapsack is a 
          square of fixed size, and the objects to pack are now polygons. Our understanding of this problem highly 
          depends on the input polygons. For example, if all polygons are axis-parallel squares you can find 
          arbitrarily-good solutions efficiently.
         </p><p align="justify">
           Our main result is an approximation algorithm that is quasi-efficient (i.e. that runs in quasi-polynomial time)
          and allows for convex polygons. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results for 
          two-dimensional Knapsack in which the input objects are not limited to axis-parallel rectangles or 
          circles and in which you can rotate by arbitrary angles.
         </p><p align="justify">

          <h3 id="Milbradt">Approximations for limit order books with large price changes</h3>
          <h4>Cassandra Milbradt (HU Berlin)</h4>
          <p align="justify">A limit order book (LOB) is an electronical tool used in economics to store
           and display unexecuted orders. One research objective is to describe realistic
           discrete dynamics of a LOB which can be approximated by a continuous time
           model. In order to apply such a model for intraday electricity markets, we aim
           to extend existing mathematical analysis of LOB models for purely nancial
           markets. In contrast to traditional stock markets, electricity markets are not
           as liquid, exhibit large spreads and unforeseen power outages can lead to
           extreme spikes in the prices, including possibly negative prices. Hence, one
           starting point in extending existing convergence results for nancial markets
           is to allow larger sizes of price changes which do not become small in the limit.
           Ensuring that these large price changes only appear with a small probability
           that scales in the right way, a convergence to a diusion approximation can
           still be proven. How can we extend these results to an approximation by a
           diusion with jumps?
