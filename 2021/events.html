          <p align="justify">
 On Thursday after the last talks you are all welcome to one more social
gathering. Details of the platform will be communicated via email to the
registered participants. It will be possible to spontaneously split in small
groups according to the interests of each one of you, much like in live events,
and within these groups one could simply have conversations with the rest
of the participants; play some online games that we will propose (and any
attendant can propose at the moment too); or anything that comes to mind.
Please come, join us and meet the other participants in a different context.</p>

        <h2>Visit to Urban Nation Museum for Urban Contemporary Art</h2>
          <p align="justify">
            Urban Nation Museum for Urban Contemporary Art is a center for street art, which is prominent in Berlin. It opened in 2017, with a goal of being not just an exhibition space, but also an archive of the history of urban art. Despite it being so new, the museum shows works of influential street artists from all over the world.
           </p><p align="justify">
          For more information, please visit the <a href="https://urban-nation.com/">museum website</a>.
            </p><p align="justify">
          To avoid overcrowding, we will form groups of around 25 people and space out the visits of the groups by 20-30 minutes. We will be meeting at <b>16:00 in the front of TU Math Building</b>. Since we will need to take UBahn to get to the museum, please <b>purchase a ticket for the trip in advance</b>.

        <h2>Wine and Cheese</h2>
          <p align="justify">
            Our traditional Wine &amp; Cheese evening is one of the highlights of the BMS year. It's an opportunity for all conference participants (including many current and prospective BMS students!) to socialise in a relaxed environment. As its name indicates, this social event is accompanied by different kinds of cheese and wine that have been selected by the organizers for the event.
            For those to don't drink alcohol or don't like cheese, there will be non-alcoholic drinks and some other snacks as well.</p>
          <p align="justify">The Wine and Cheese will take place at the BMS Lounge in the Technische Universit&auml;t Berlin, starting at HH:MM. More information about its location can be found on the <a href="venue.html">venue page</a>. More information about the schedule can be found on the <a href="schedule.html">schedule page</a>.</p>
          <p align="justify">Every conference participant is invited to join the Wine and Cheese!</p>
