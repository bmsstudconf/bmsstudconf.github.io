          <h3 id="Arezzo">Constant scalar curvature metrics on Algebraic manifolds</h3>
          <h4>Prof. Claudio Arezzo (University of Parma)</h4>
          
		  <p align="left"> In this talk I will recall motivations and foundational results on the classical problem of finding “the best” metric on a given algebraic manifold, and how analytic, geometrical and algebraic techniques get together to help this long standing (still very much open) problem.
        After recalling a general framework to prove existence of Einstein and constant scalar curvature metrics on algebraic varieties, we apply a recent breakthrough by Chen-Cheng to study the existence problem of such metrics on Galois covers, connecting the analytic theory to various geometrical constructions in the cyclic, abelian and non-abelian cases.</p>

			<!--Student talks will be displayed here.-->
			
			<div id="zama">
			<h3 id="Backhaus">Trace and Dimension in Category Theory</h3>
			<h4>Mark Backhaus (FU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> The trace of a linear map is a fundamental invariant that is both easy to compute and incredibly useful. For example the trace of the identity map of a given vector space computes its dimension, and we can detect fixed points of continuous maps between topological spaces by computing the traces of certain induced linear maps.</p>
			
			<p align="justify"> This can be generalised to a much more abstract setting. If \(\mathcal C\) is a category that has an appropriate notion of tensor product and \(V\) is an object that has a "dual object"\(V^\ast\) we can define a notion of trace for any map \(V\to V\) and define the dimension of \(V\) to be the trace of its identity. This can yield surprising results depending on the ambient category. For example, we can recover the Euler characteristic of a space as the dimension of a chain complex. Furthermore we could ask questions such as &ldquo;What is the dimension of a category?&rdquo; </p>
      
      <p align="justify">In this talk I will first go over the minimum amount of background knowledge in category theory needed and then sketch the general theory. </p>

			</div>
			
			<div id="zama">
			<h3 id="Chemnitz">Positive Lyapunov Exponent in the Hopf Normal Form with Additive Noise</h3>
			<h4>Dennis Chemnitz (FU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify">Lyapunov exponents are a measure for instability and entropy in both deterministic and random dynamical systems. Finding lower bounds for the top Lyapunov exponents of a system is in general difficult and of interest in, for example, the field of fluid dynamics. In this talk I will explain the basic concepts behind Lyapunov exponents in random dynamical systems and outline my recent work on proving the possibility of positive Lyapunov exponents in the Hopf Normal Form with Additive Noise. This is based on joint work with Maximilian Engel. </p>

			</div>
			
			<div id="zama">
			<h3 id="Chun">Finite Sphere Packings in Low and High Dimensions</h3>
			<h4>Ji Hoon Chun (TU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify">The Sausage Conjecture of L. Fejes T\'oth (1975) states that for all dimensions \(d \geq 5\), the densest packing of any finite number of spheres in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ occurs if and only if the sphere centers are all placed as closely as possible on one line, i.e., a ``sausage.'' We discuss the progress made in the literature, including the result of Betke and Henk (1998) that the Sausage Conjecture is true for all $d \geq 42$. Our work builds upon the methods of Betke and Henk to improve the lower bound to $d \geq 36$ with the aid of interval arithmetic. </p>
			
			<p align="justify">The Sausage Catastrophe of J. Wills (1983) is the observation that in $d = 3$ and $d = 4$, the densest packing of $n$ spheres is a sausage for small values of $n$ and jumps to a full-dimensional packing for large $n$ without passing through any intermediate dimensions. Let $n_{d}^{*}$ be the smallest value of $n$ for which the densest packing of $n$ spheres in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is full-dimensional. We discuss some upper and lower bounds for $n_{3}^{*}$ and $n_{4}^{*}$, including $n_{3}^{*} \leq 56$ by Wills (1985) and $n_{4}^{*} \leq 375,\!769$ by Gandini and Zucco (1992). We extend the work of Gandini and Zucco to obtain a new upper bound of $n_{4}^{*} \leq 338,\!192$, and conclude by stating some potential future research directions for both the conjecture and the catastrophe.</p>

      <p align="justify">\emph{The result for the Sausage Conjecture is joint work with Martin Henk.}</p>

			<h3 id="Crespo">Nehari manifold approach for superlinear double phase problems with variable exponents</h3>
			<h4>Angel Crespo-Blanco (TU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> During the last decade the so-called double phase operator has drawn attention from researchers. Originally it was introduced by Zhikov in the context of homogenization and elasticity theory and as an example for the Lavrentiev phenomenon. It regained popularity after some novel regularity results for local minimizers of the corresponding functional.</p>

      <p align="justify"> In this talk we consider quasilinear elliptic equations driven by the variable exponent double phase operator with superlinear right-hand sides. Under very general assumptions on the nonlinearity we prove a multiplicity result for such problems, whereby we show the existence of a positive solution, a negative one and a solution with changing sign. The sign-changing solution is obtained via the Nehari manifold approach and, in addition, we can also give information on its nodal domains. Furthermore, we derive a priori estimates on the solutions in the $L^\infty$-norm under the very general setting used above.</p>

      <p align="justify"> This is joint work with P. Winkert.</p>

			<h3 id="Ergen">Farthest Insertion Heuristic for TSP</h3>
			<h4>Ekin Ergen (TU Berlin)</h4>
			TBD
			<!--<p align="justify"> The Traveling Salesman Problem is one of the prominent NP-hard problems in combinatorial optimization. Given a complete graph with nonnegative edge weights, the task is to find a minimum-weight Hamiltonian cycle. This talk is about a special family of approximation algorithms, the insertion heuristics, which are widely used in practice. Among them, Farthest Insertion yields especially favorable empirical accuracy, although no approximation ratio better than the general case is known for this algorithm. </p>
			
			<p align="justify"> We present the currently known worst-case instance admitting an approximation ratio of $6.5$ due to Hurkens and sketch an improvement to this instance that yields a ratio of $7$. We discuss the possibility of further improvements on the instance, in particular that of obtaining a nonconstant lower bound. </p>
			
			<p align="justify"> In an attempt to understand insertion heuristics better, we later restrict ourselves to $(1,2)$-TSP, that is, TSP on instances with edge weights in $\{1,2\}$. Our analysis of Farthest Insertion on this subproblem yields an approximation ratio of $5/3$ which can be shown to be tight. We also prove that the upper bound of $5/3$ holds for any insertion heuristic. </p>
			
			<p align="justify"> This talk is based on ongoing work. </p>

			<h3 id="Hegab">What is... Non-archimedean geometry?</h3>
			<h4>Fawzy Hegab (HU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> Early in my undergraduate studies, I was dreaming for a world in which a series would converge it its terms tend to zero. As widely known, this is very far from being the case.. or so have we been told? Notions of convergence are metric-dependent. In the Non-archimedean world, my dreams come as true. A series converge whenever its terms tend to zero! However, this comes at a price, every triangle is isosceles, and given any two disks, either they are disjoint, or one is contained in another.</p>

      <p align="justify"> In this talk, we will discuss the motivations to study non-Archimedean geometry, as well as their importance in the modern study of number theory (as time permits). Our main focus will be to touch on the new (fascinating) phenomena that we observe in the Non-Archimedean world. The talk is meant for a wider mathematical audience. No knowledge of number theory, algebraic geometry, etc... is assumed. If you know what it means for a sequence to converge, you already know more than enough to fully follow the talk with ease!</p>

			<h3 id="Koeppl">Dynamical Gibbs Variational Principles for Irreversible Interacting Particle Systems with Applications to Attractor Properties</h3>
			<h4>Jonas Köppl (WIAS)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> Interacting particle systems are countable systems of locally interacting Markov processes and are often used as toy models for stochastic phenomena with an underlying spatial structure. Even though the definition of an interacting particle system often looks very simple and the major technical issues of existence and uniqueness have long been settled, it is in general surprisingly difficult to say anything non-trivial about their behavior. Some of the main challenges deal with the long-time behavior of the systems. Because of the possible non-uniqueness of the time-stationary distribution the analysis is very delicate and various techniques have been developed to study limit theorems or attractor properties. One particular technique that will play a major role in this talk is due to Richard Holley and involves using the relative entropy functional with respect to some specification $\gamma$ as a Lyapunov function for the measure-valued differential equation that describes the time evolution of the system in the space of measures. We first explain the general idea behind the method on the simple example of a continuous time Markov chain on a finite state space and then discuss how one can extend it to irreversible interacting particle systems in infinite volumes. </p>

			<h3 id="Moretti">Linear series via kernel bundles: an application to the degree of irrationality of K3 surfaces.</h3>
			<h4>Federico Moretti (HU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> A natural way to understand an algebraic variety is understanding its possible realizations in projective spaces. I will recall some basic facts about line bundles and hyperplane-sections. Then I will present a way to understand higher codimension linear sections via vector bundles. As an application I will compute the degree of irrationality of low genus K3 surfaces.</p>

			<div id="zama">
			<h3 id="Nansubuga">TBA</h3>
			<h4>Martha Nansubuga (HU Berlin)</h4>
			TBA<!--
			<p align="justify"> If a previously deformed wire made out of special Nickel-Titanium is heated, the wire returns to its original form. This phenomenon is called the shape-memory effect. The cooling (or heating) of a material leads to a first order solid-to-solid phase transformation. During the cooling the lattice structure of a material changes abruptly at a critical temperature. The high temperature phase is called austenite and the low temperature phase is called martensite. Cooling of the austenite leads to the abrupt formation of martensitic nuclei.  Heating reverts the martensitic transformation, i.e. the lattice structure changes at a high temperature back to the lattice structure of the austenite. </p>

			<p align="justify"> We are interested in the martensitic phase transformation with two martensitic variants. In particular, we aim at a better understanding of the appearing microstructure, i.e. the geometry at the very small scale-structure, emerging during a martensitic phase transformation. Therfore, we study a mathematical model postulated by Kohn and Müller (1992 & 1994), which leads us to a nonconvex singularly perturbed variational problem. We prove asymptotic self-similarity of minimizers. Our results generalize the result by Conti (2000) to various physically relevant  boundary conditions, more general domains, and arbitrary volume fractions. </p>
			
			<p align="justify"> This is joint work with Sergio Conti, Johannes Diermeier, and Barbara Zwicknagl. </p>

			<h3 id="Reiter">Analysis and numerical approximation of the Ericksen--Leslie equations </h3>
			<h4>Maximilian Reiter (TU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify">The Ericksen-Leslie equations are used to model liquid crystals in their nematic phase. We define a generalized solution concept based on a relative energy approach for the Ericksen--Leslie equations in three spatial dimensions. This solution concept satisfies the weak-strong uniqueness property. For a certain choice of the regularity weight, we construct an energy-variational solution with the help of an implementable, structure-inheriting space-time discretization. Computational studies are performed in order to provide some evidence of the applicability of the proposed algorithm.</p>

			<div id="zama">
			<h3 id="Ribeiro">Hodge Theory for Curves</h3>
			<h4>Joaquim Boas Ribeiro (FU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> Hodge Theory originated as a powerful tool to study the geometry of certain complex manifolds using their complex, rational and integer cohomology, with vast generalizations and applications in several areas of mathematics. The basic idea is that the cohomology of these manifolds has more structure than that of their underlying topological spaces. In this talk, we use the historically important example of elliptic curves to introduce some fundamental concepts of Hodge Theory: Hodge structure, the period map and the period domain. </p>

			<h3 id="Rothgang">A glimpse at symplectic geometry and pseudo-holomorphic curves</h3>
			<h4>Michael Rothgang (HU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify">The mathematical treatment of classical mechanics naturally leads to symplectic geometry, the study of symplectic manifolds. Symplectic geometry has rich connections to various branches of mathematics, such as enumerative and algebraic geometry, functional analysis, elliptic partial differential equations and dynamical systems. We present some results illuminating these connections. </p>

      <p align="justify">A fundamental tool for many of these connections are pseudo-holomorphic curves. We give an overview of their theory, discuss some fundamental questions which are still open and indicate some avenues for addressing them. No prior knowledge of symplectic geometry will be assumed. </p>

			<h3 id="Umer">From Teichmüller theory to topological recursion
      </h3>
			<h4>Giacomo Umer (HU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> In 2004, with her PhD thesis, Maryam Mirzakhani presented a recursive formula computing the Weil-Petersson volume of moduli space of bordered Riemann surfaces, subsequently leading to a new proof of Witten’s conjecture/Kontsevich theorem. In this talk I’ll give a brief introduction to the topic, showing in particular how such a result can be viewed as an example of Eynard-Orantin topological recursion, for which I'll provide the basic notions and most notable applications. </p>

			<h3 id="Wagenhofer">Weak error estimates for rough volatility models</h3>
			<h4>Thomas Wagenhofer (TU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> Rough volatility models are a class of financial modeling techniques which have been developed to better capture the behavior of financial markets by allowing the volatility of an asset to be a rough, i.e.\ nonsmooth, function. </p>

      <p align="justify"> One aproach for this models includes the use of fractional Brownian motions, whose roughness is parametrized by the so-called Hurst prameter $H\in (0,1/2]$. When simulating these models, one often uses a discretization of stochastic integrals as an approximation.</p>

      <p align="justify"> Our main result is that moments of these integrals have a so-called weak error rate of order $3H+1/2$ if \(H \less 1/6\) and order $1$ otherwise. To show this result we first derive a moment formula for both the discretization and the true stochastic integral. We then use this moment formula and properties of Gaussian random variables to prove our main theorems. </p>

      <p align="justify"> Note that our rate of $3H+1/2$ is in stark contrast to the strong error rate which is of order $H$, meaning that the weak error decreases much faster. </p>

      <p align="justify"> This is a joint work with William Salkeld and Peter Friz. </p>
