          <h3 id="Arezzo">Constant scalar curvature metrics on Algebraic manifolds</h3>
          <h4>Prof. Claudio Arezzo (University of Parma)</h4>
          
		  <p align="left"> In this talk I will recall motivations and foundational results on the classical problem of finding “the best” metric on a given algebraic manifold, and how analytic, geometrical and algebraic techniques get together to help this long standing (still very much open) problem.
        After recalling a general framework to prove existence of Einstein and constant scalar curvature metrics on algebraic varieties, we apply a recent breakthrough by Chen-Cheng to study the existence problem of such metrics on Galois covers, connecting the analytic theory to various geometrical constructions in the cyclic, abelian and non-abelian cases.</p>

			<!--Student talks will be displayed here.-->
			
			<div id="zama">
			<h3 id="Backhaus">Trace and Dimension in Category Theory</h3>
			<h4>Mark Backhaus (FU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> The trace of a linear map is a fundamental invariant that is both easy to compute and incredibly useful. For example the trace of the identity map of a given vector space computes its dimension, and we can detect fixed points of continuous maps between topological spaces by computing the traces of certain induced linear maps.</p>
			
			<p align="justify"> This can be generalised to a much more abstract setting. If $\mathcal C$ is a category that has an appropriate notion of tensor product and $V$ is an object that has a "dual object" $V^\ast$ we can define a notion of trace for any map $V\to V$ and define the dimension of $V$ to be the trace of its identity. This can yield surprising results depending on the ambient category. For example, we can recover the Euler characteristic of a space as the dimension of a chain complex. Furthermore we could ask questions such as &ldquo;What is the dimension of a category?&rdquo; </p>
      
      <p align="justify">In this talk I will first go over the minimum amount of background knowledge in category theory needed and then sketch the general theory. </p>

			</div>
			
			<div id="zama">
			<h3 id="Chemnitz">Positive Lyapunov Exponent in the Hopf Normal Form with Additive Noise</h3>
			<h4>Dennis Chemnitz (FU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify">Lyapunov exponents are a measure for instability and entropy in both deterministic and random dynamical systems. Finding lower bounds for the top Lyapunov exponents of a system is in general difficult and of interest in, for example, the field of fluid dynamics. In this talk I will explain the basic concepts behind Lyapunov exponents in random dynamical systems and outline my recent work on proving the possibility of positive Lyapunov exponents in the Hopf Normal Form with Additive Noise. This is based on joint work with Maximilian Engel. </p>

			</div>
			
			<div id="zama">
			<h3 id="Chun">Finite Sphere Packings in Low and High Dimensions</h3>
			<h4>Ji Hoon Chun (TU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify">The Sausage Conjecture of L. Fejes T\'oth (1975) states that for all dimensions $d \geq 5$, the densest packing of any finite number of spheres in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ occurs if and only if the sphere centers are all placed as closely as possible on one line, i.e., a ``sausage.'' We discuss the progress made in the literature, including the result of Betke and Henk (1998) that the Sausage Conjecture is true for all $d \geq 42$. Our work builds upon the methods of Betke and Henk to improve the lower bound to $d \geq 36$ with the aid of interval arithmetic. </p>
			
			<p align="justify">The Sausage Catastrophe of J. Wills (1983) is the observation that in $d = 3$ and $d = 4$, the densest packing of $n$ spheres is a sausage for small values of $n$ and jumps to a full-dimensional packing for large $n$ without passing through any intermediate dimensions. Let $n_{d}^{*}$ be the smallest value of $n$ for which the densest packing of $n$ spheres in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is full-dimensional. We discuss some upper and lower bounds for $n_{3}^{*}$ and $n_{4}^{*}$, including $n_{3}^{*} \leq 56$ by Wills (1985) and $n_{4}^{*} \leq 375,\!769$ by Gandini and Zucco (1992). We extend the work of Gandini and Zucco to obtain a new upper bound of $n_{4}^{*} \leq 338,\!192$, and conclude by stating some potential future research directions for both the conjecture and the catastrophe.</p>

      <p align="justify">\emph{The result for the Sausage Conjecture is joint work with Martin Henk.}</p>

			<h3 id="Crespo">Nehari manifold approach for superlinear double phase problems with variable exponents</h3>
			<h4>Angel Crespo-Blanco (TU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> During the last decade the so-called double phase operator has drawn attention from researchers. Originally it was introduced by Zhikov in the context of homogenization and elasticity theory and as an example for the Lavrentiev phenomenon. It regained popularity after some novel regularity results for local minimizers of the corresponding functional.</p>

      <p align="justify"> In this talk we consider quasilinear elliptic equations driven by the variable exponent double phase operator with superlinear right-hand sides. Under very general assumptions on the nonlinearity we prove a multiplicity result for such problems, whereby we show the existence of a positive solution, a negative one and a solution with changing sign. The sign-changing solution is obtained via the Nehari manifold approach and, in addition, we can also give information on its nodal domains. Furthermore, we derive a priori estimates on the solutions in the $L^\infty$-norm under the very general setting used above.</p>

      <p align="justify"> This is joint work with P. Winkert.</p>

			<div id="zama">
			<h3 id="Ergen">Farthest Insertion Heuristic for TSP</h3>
			<h4>Ekin Ergen (TU Berlin)</h4>
			TBD
			<!--<p align="justify"> The Traveling Salesman Problem is one of the prominent NP-hard problems in combinatorial optimization. Given a complete graph with nonnegative edge weights, the task is to find a minimum-weight Hamiltonian cycle. This talk is about a special family of approximation algorithms, the insertion heuristics, which are widely used in practice. Among them, Farthest Insertion yields especially favorable empirical accuracy, although no approximation ratio better than the general case is known for this algorithm. </p>
			
			<p align="justify"> We present the currently known worst-case instance admitting an approximation ratio of $6.5$ due to Hurkens and sketch an improvement to this instance that yields a ratio of $7$. We discuss the possibility of further improvements on the instance, in particular that of obtaining a nonconstant lower bound. </p>
			
			<p align="justify"> In an attempt to understand insertion heuristics better, we later restrict ourselves to $(1,2)$-TSP, that is, TSP on instances with edge weights in $\{1,2\}$. Our analysis of Farthest Insertion on this subproblem yields an approximation ratio of $5/3$ which can be shown to be tight. We also prove that the upper bound of $5/3$ holds for any insertion heuristic. </p>
			
			<p align="justify"> This talk is based on ongoing work. </p>

			<h3 id="Hegab">What is... Non-archimedean geometry?</h3>
			<h4>Fawzy Hegab (HU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> Early in my undergraduate studies, I was dreaming for a world in which a
        series would converge it its terms tend to zero. As widely known, this is very
        far from being the case.. or so have we been told? Notions of convergence are
        metric-dependent. In the Non-archimedean world, my dreams come as true.
        A series converge whenever its terms tend to zero! However, this comes at
        a price, every triangle is isosceles, and given any two disks, either they are
        disjoint, or one is contained in another.</p>

      <p align="justify"> In this talk, we will discuss the motivations to study non-Archimedean
        geometry, as well as their importance in the modern study of number theory
        (as time permits). Our main focus will be to touch on the new (fascinating)
        phenomena that we observe in the Non-Archimedean world. The talk is meant
        for a wider mathematical audience. No knowledge of number theory, algebraic
        geometry, etc... is assumed. If you know what it means for a sequence to
        converge, you already know more than enough to fully follow the talk with
        ease!</p>

			<h3 id="Koeppl">Viability of Nonlinear Statistical Shape Models for Medical Applications</h3>
			<h4>Jonas Koeppl (WIAS)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> In the modern medical field, algorithmic or AI-based approaches can be taken to guide reconstructive surgery or potentially even 3d printing of organs, but generating medically viable shapes is still computationally difficult. One particular tool used in collecting and generating shapes is the Statistical Shape Model (SSM), which is a compact geometric model that describes a collection of similar multidimensional object, by containing a mean and shape variation. Uses of the SSM could be to classify a scan into healthy or pathological or to generate a best-fitting shape to match an existing body.  </p>
			
			<p align="justify"> The traditional SSM takes a linear approach to this and is computationally quite efficient, but in the medical field, there are numerous examples where linear interpolation yields a medically non viable output. In this talk, I will give an overview of SSMs and examine some non-linear approaches that attempt to solve the problem of medical viability.  </p>

			<div id="zama">
			<h3 id="Moretti">Fast stochastic optimization with Vaidya’s cutting plane method</h3>
			<h4>Federico Moretti (HU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> The article considers minimization of the expectation of convex function. Problems of such type often arise in machine learning and a number of other applications. In practice, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and similar procedures are often used to solve such problems. We propose to use Vaidya's cutting plane method with minibatching, which converges linearly and requires significantly less iterations than SGD on a class of problems. This is verified in our experiment, where the algorithm is applied to train logistic regression model for the binary classification problem. The algorithm does not require neither smoothness nor strong convexity of target function to achieve linear convergence. We prove that the method arrives at approximate solution with given probability when using minibatches of size proportional to \(\varepsilon^{-2}\), where \(\varepsilon\) is the desired precision. This enables efficient parallel execution of the algorithm, whereas possibilities for batch parallelization of SGD are rather limited. Despite fast convergence, Vaidya's cutting plane method can result in a greater total number of calls to oracle than SGD, which works decently with small batches. Complexity is proportional to \(n \ln n\), where \(n\) is the dimension of the problem, hence the method is suitable for relatively small dimensionalities. </p>

			<h3 id="Nansubuga">Asymptotic self-similarity for a model of
	shape-memory alloys</h3>
			<h4>Martha Nansubuga (HU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> If a previously deformed wire made out of special Nickel-Titanium is heated, the wire returns to its original form. This phenomenon is called the shape-memory effect. The cooling (or heating) of a material leads to a first order solid-to-solid phase transformation. During the cooling the lattice structure of a material changes abruptly at a critical temperature. The high temperature phase is called austenite and the low temperature phase is called martensite. Cooling of the austenite leads to the abrupt formation of martensitic nuclei.  Heating reverts the martensitic transformation, i.e. the lattice structure changes at a high temperature back to the lattice structure of the austenite. </p>

			<p align="justify"> We are interested in the martensitic phase transformation with two martensitic variants. In particular, we aim at a better understanding of the appearing microstructure, i.e. the geometry at the very small scale-structure, emerging during a martensitic phase transformation. Therfore, we study a mathematical model postulated by Kohn and Müller (1992 & 1994), which leads us to a nonconvex singularly perturbed variational problem. We prove asymptotic self-similarity of minimizers. Our results generalize the result by Conti (2000) to various physically relevant  boundary conditions, more general domains, and arbitrary volume fractions. </p>
			
			<p align="justify"> This is joint work with Sergio Conti, Johannes Diermeier, and Barbara Zwicknagl. </p>

			<h3 id="Reiter">Generalized permutahedra and positive flag Dressians</h3>
			<h4>Maximilian Reiter (TU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> We study valuated matroids, their tropical incidence relations, flag matroids and total positivity. Our techniques employ the polyhedral geometry of the hypersimplices, the regular permutahedra and their subdivisions. </p>

			</div>
			
			<div id="zama">
			<h3 id="Ribeiro">Port-Hamiltonian systems and structure-preserving collocation</h3>
			<h4>Joaquim Boas Ribeiro (FU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> The progressive technical and scientific development within human society requires us to work on increasingly complex systems. For example, the transition to green energy introduces new kinds of energy sources in the power network, like solar panels and wind turbines, that are inherently more unstable and erratic than the ones based on fossil fuel combustion. The models and methods currently used to regulate power networks are unfortunately insufficient to deal with these much more dynamical systems. These challenges have been driving the development of modern and flexible modeling paradigms. One of these is the one of port-Hamiltonian systems. </p>
			
			<p align="justify"> Port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems are ubiquitous, covering diverse physical domains and allowing easy modularization. This is achieved by recognizing energy as the "lingua franca" between physical domains, and using it both to drive the dynamics of the system and to interconnect different systems in a conservative way. Mathematically, pH systems bring together port-based modeling, geometric mechanics, and systems and control theory. PH systems present a plethora of good qualities, which make them particularly suitable for modeling, analysis, numerics, and control. </p>
			
			<p align="justify"> In this talk, we will first introduce the modeling paradigm and the geometric interpretation of port-Hamiltonian systems. This will lead us to an alternative formulation as pH differential-algebraic equations (pHDAE) with input and output variables, also known as port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems. After listing some of the good properties of pHDAEs, we will focus on a specific but simple numerical scheme: collocation methods for time integration. In particular, we will show that the Gauss-Legendre collocation scheme always preserves the structure of a certain class of pHDAEs. </p>

			<h3 id="Rothgang">A GIT construction of the stalk of coherent sheaves</h3>
			<h4>Michael Rothgang (HU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify">The study of the moduli stack Coh(X) of coherent sheaves on a projective scheme X, has far-reaching results in the theory of moduli spaces, non-abelian Hodge correspondence, minimal model program, hyperkähler geometry and beyond. in this talk we present a construction of such a classifying space through the methods of Geometric Invariant Theory. </p>
			
			<ul>
			<li><p align="justify">Coh as a moduli problem: In the first part, we introduce a proper framework for the development of moduli problems. We first define presheaves of sets over the site of schemes. This approach will lead us to the notion of a moduli space (i.e a moduli functor being represented by a scheme). Then we review two of the most well known phenomena that arise whenever this representability is not possible, namely the jump phenomena and the unboundedness of a moduli problem. We give a detailed example that shows that the moduli problem of coherent sheaves is not bounded. Even though we cannot build the desired moduli space, Geometric Invariant Theory tells us how to further restrict the moduli problem in order to salvage a relevant smaller moduli space. </p></li>

			<li><p align="justify">GIT and corepresentability: In the second part, we present the GIT solution to the corepresentability of a moduli problem. First we construct the Quot moduli functor and discuss its representability by a projective scheme, which is suitably embedded into a Grassmannian. Then we define G-linearisations for the action of a reductive algebraic group on a k-scheme over an algebraically closed field k. After that we relate corepresentability of a moduli problem of interest to the problem of finding a quotient for the group action. And finally we present the main theorem of GIT which produces the moduli space of coherent semistable sheaves over X. </p></li>

			<h3 id="Umer">Membrane models: Variational Analysis and Large Deviations Principle in subcritical dimensions</h3>
			<h4>Giacomo Umer (HU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> In-depth understanding of the bending behaviour of a membrane is often considered essential for explaining cellular properties, as well as some material properties and can lead to advancements in fields of biology and material science. In this talk we present two classical approaches to model a membrane - a deterministic and a stochastic one. We first consider a variational model for a membrane that is strongly attracted to two walls, and characterize optimal membrane shapes by means of Γ-convergence. We show how this approach is linked to the variational model considered above via Large Deviations Principles. The incorporation of various cons- traints is also discussed. </p>
			
			<p align="justify">
			This talk is based on a Master Thesis done under the supervision of B. Zwicknagl and J. Deuschel. </p>

			<h3 id="Wagenhofer">Direct low-rank approximation of transfer operators and coherent sets</h3>
			<h4>Thomas Wagenhofer (TU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> The topic of the present paper has been motivated by a recent computational framework that provides highly scalable identification of reduced Bayesian and Markov relation models and the inclusion of a priori physical information. An efficient approach to date for the identification of finite-time coherent sets in time-dependent dynamical systems on the other hand are transfer operators. Numerical techniques for this purpose rely on the estimation and further numerical processing of a transition matrix. In this article, we reinterpret a directly low-rank transfer operator as a product of the Ulam matrix and a stochastic projection which depends on affiliations to the so-called latent states. Our method can be seen as an extension of Bayesian model reduction directly from trajectory data, and it allows us to identify a low rank projected transfer operator together with the associated transition probabilities. We illustrate the potential of the method on several examples. </p>
