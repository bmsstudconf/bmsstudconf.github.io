          <h3 id="Swaminathan">Compactness theorem for holomorphic curves and a partial converse</h3>
          <h4>Prof. Mohan Swaminathan (Standford University)</h4>
          
		  <p align="left"> A "holomorphic curve" is a complex analytic mapping from a compact Riemann surface to a complex projective variety. These objects and their generalizations play an important role in algebraic geometry and symplectic topology. 
        The space of holomorphic curves (of a fixed topological type) is a priori non-compact, but a fundamental theorem due to Gromov shows that any sequence escaping to infinity in this space has a subsequence converging to a "holomorphic curve with mild singularities". After explaining this result, I'll focus on its converse: given a singular holomorphic curve, when is it actually realizable as the limit of a sequence as above? I'll present a partial answer to this, which turns out to be intimately connected to the classical theory of meromorphic functions on compact Riemann surfaces (based on joint work with Fatemeh Rezaee).

      <!-- ---------------------------------------------------  -->    
			<!--Student talks will be displayed here.-->
			

			<div id="zama">
			  <h3 id="Pesic">Curvature-driven Pattern Formation in Biomembranes</h3>
			  <h4>Anastasija Pesic </h4>
			
			    <p align="justify"> Biological membranes are thin structures that are composed of various components. The different components often form microdomains, called lipid rafts, that are arranged in complex patterns.
            To explain this pattern formation, variational models based on Cahn-Hilliard type energies have been introduced that couple the local composition of the membrane to its local curvature, which renders the resulting functionals nonlocal.
          </p>
				
          <p align="justify"> The main focus of this talk lies on the derivation of the  \( \mathcal \Gamma\)-limit in a certain parameter regime where the limiting functional turns out to be of perimeter-type. As a main novelty, we will present a technique to include Neumann-boundary conditions in the construction of a recovery sequence. 
            Additionally, in the remaining parameter regimes scaling behavior of the infimal energy will be discussed.
          </p>

      <div id="zama">
        <h3 id="Kipp"> Small Perturbations of Polytopes </h3>
        <h4>Christian Kipp</h4>
        
          <p align="justify"> 
            Motivated by first-order conditions for extremal bodies of geometric functionals, we study a functional analytic notion of infinitesimal perturbations of convex bodies and give a full characterization of the set of realizable perturbations if the perturbed body is a polytope.
          </p>
               
      </div>
			

			<div id="zama">
			  <h3 id="Bögel">FMM-Net: A GNN for long-range interactions drawing upon the fast multipole method (FMM)</h3>
			  <h4>Coco Bögel</h4>
			
			  <p align="justify">
          The Fast Multipole Method is a widespread method to speed up \( \mathcal N\)-body calculations and enable simulations on large scales. In the project for my Master thesis, I developed a machine learning algorithm, more specifically a graph neural network, which uses the same hierarchical structure as the FMM and has the same benefits of speeding up the computation. 
          I also tested this hierarchical GNN on problems from computational chemistry, i.e. prediction of properties of molecules from their molecular graph.

			<div id="zama">
			  <h3 id="Luber"> Singular matroid realization spaces</h3>
			  <h4>Dante Luber</h4>
			
			  <p align="justify">
          We discuss the basics of realizable matroids, and closely associated objects called realization spaces. We use software to study large datasets of matroid realization spaces, and produce examples of reducible and singular spaces.
        </p>

			<div id="zama">
			  <h3 id="Ergen">Total Completion Time Scheduling Under Scenarios</h3>
			  <h4>Ekin Ergen (TU Berlin)</h4>
			  <p align="justify"> 
          Scheduling jobs with given processing times on identical parallel machines so as to minimize the sum of their completion times is one of the most basic scheduling problems. 
          We study interesting generalizations of this classical problem involving a finite number of scenarios. In our model, a scenario is defined as a subset of a predefined and fully specified set of jobs.
          The aim is to find an assignment of the whole set of jobs to identical parallel machines such that the schedule, obtained for the given scenarios by simply skipping the jobs not in the scenario, optimizes the average sum of completion times over all scenarios. 
      </p>
			<p align="justify"> 
          We conjecture a structural property of optimal schedules, which implies a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem, and prove special cases of this conjecture using diverse methods in combinatorics and polyhedra.

			<h3 id="Flores"> tba </h3>
			  <h4>Marco Flores</h4>
			
			  <p align="justify"> 
          The geometry of compactifications of the moduli space of abelian varieties can be leveraged to deduce modularity theorems of formal Siegel-Jacobi forms.
        </p>
              
      </div>
			

			<div id="zama">
			  <h3 id="Rothgang">An invitation to formalising mathematics</h3>
			  <h4>Michael Rothgang</h4>
			
			  <p align="justify">
          Are you wondering what the recent excitement about Lean is about? What the formalisation of deep theorems (such as the liquid tensor experiment, sphere eversion or the unit fractions project) means?
          Why we would be interested in doing this? I will answer all these questions and give an impression of the current state of things. There will also be some pointers to how to get involved.
        </p>

			<div id="zama">
			  <h3 id="Manikandan">Exploring Low-Dimensional Manifolds: A Topological and Geometric Perspective</h3>
			  <h4>Naageswaran Manikandan</h4>
			
			  <p align="justify"> 
          This talk centers on low-dimensional manifolds, i.e.,3 and 4 dimensions, approaching them from both a topological viewpoint and through the rich lenses of contact and symplectic geometry.
          We explore the common tools employed for understanding them and highlight the increased complexity introduced by contact and symplectic structures.
        </p>

			<div id="zama">
			  <h3 id="Sadovek">Convex Equipartitions and the Nandakumar — Ramana Rao problem </h3>
			  <h4>Nikola Sadovek </h4>
			
			  <p align="justify">
          I would like to talk about a problem of partitioning a convex polygon into convex pieces of equal area and equal perimeter. 
          It has been conjectured that one can always do that 20 years ago, but people have been able to prove it only when the number of pieces is a prime power. 
          I would explain how this problems translates to a question in Algebraic Topology, touch on what is known and what are the obstacles. 
          The talk would be based on a recent paper of mine with Pavle Blagojevic.

			  <h3 id="Gubela"> tba </h3>
			  <h4>Nils Gubela</h4>
			
			  <p align="justify">
          In this talk, we delve into the world of mathematical modelling as a tool for understanding and predicting the spread of infectious diseases. Navigating through the complexities of epidemiology, we explore how mathematical models serve as virtual laboratories, allowing us to simulate and analyse different scenarios. 
          Key to this are stochastic sampling algorithms. We discuss strategies to accelerate stochastic simulations while maintaining robust accuracy

			  <h3 id="Okunola"> tba </h3>
			  <h4>Toluwani Okunola</h4>
			
			  <p align="justify">
          This work proposes a method for learning the long-term dynamics of slowly changing battery aging parameters (capacity and internal resistance) starting from fast changing measurements. 
          The methodology combines the use of Kalman Filters at the fast time scale to estimate the slow-scale parameters and Artificial Neural Networks on the slow time scale to learn a model for the slowly changing battery aging parameters.

			  <h3 id="Rehberg"> (Rational) Ehrhart Theory </h3>
			  <h4>Sophie Rehberg </h4>
			
			  <p align="justify"> 
          The Ehrhart quasipolynomial of a rational polytope P encodes fundamental  arithmetic data of P, namely, the number of integer lattice points in  positive integral dilates of P. 
          Ehrhart quasipolynomials were introduced  in the 1960s, satisfy several fundamental structural results and have  applications in many areas of mathematics and beyond. 
          The enumerative theory of lattice points in rational (equivalently, real) dilates of rational polytopes is much younger, starting with work by Linke (2011),  Baldoni-Berline-Koeppe-Vergne (2013), and Stapledon (2017). 

        </p>

        <p align="justify"> 
          We introduce  a generating-function ansatz for rational Ehrhart quasipolynomials,  which unifies several known results in classical and rational Ehrhart  theory. 
          In particular, we define y-rational Gorenstein polytopes, which  extend the classical notion to the rational setting. This is joint work  with Matthias Beck and Sophia Elia.

			  <h3 id="Majewski ">Exploring the Geometric Landscape: A Journey through Riemannian Geometry, Special Holonomy Spaces, and String Theory </h3>
			  <h4>Viktor Majewski  </h4>
			
			  <p align="justify"> 
          Embark on a 30-minute journey through the fascinating realm of Riemannian geometry, delving into the intricate structures of special holonomy spaces such as Calabi-Yau manifolds, G2 manifolds, and Spin(7) manifolds.
          This talk will unravel the connections between these geometric objects and their pivotal role in the theoretical framework of Super String theory and M theory. Discover the construction methods employed in the creation of Spin(7) manifolds and the significance of Spin(7)-Instantons, showcasing the rich interplay between geometry and physics. 
          The exploration extends to Cayley submanifolds, shedding light on their role in shaping our understanding of higher-dimensional spaces. Join us for a concise yet comprehensive exploration of these captivating topics at the crossroads of mathematics and theoretical physics.
