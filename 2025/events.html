There will also be non-alcoholic drink options as well as various other snacks including some vegan options.

          <p align="justify">The Wine and Cheese will take place at the lecture hall <b>H1035</b> in the Main Building of TU Berlin.

            After the official end of the conference on <b>Friday</b>, we invite you to join us for the annual BMS Career event! The event will be held from <b>14:00-16:00</b> followed by a catered reception.
          </p><p align="justify">
            If you have ever wondered what BMS alumni are doing after their masters or PhD or if you are wondering about a career in industry or academia, come listen and ask about the experiences of two academics and three BMS alumni currently working in industry!

            There will be a panel interview/discussion as well as a question and answer session. You could submit questions that you would like us to ask via the registration form but you can also just ask them yourself at the event! You do not have to be registered for the conference to attend, but there was a separate <a href="registration.html">registration</a> process just for this event, which is now also closed. Unregistered BMS Phase I and II students are welcome to attend (up to the capacity of the room), but the opportunity to submit questions in advance is no longer available.
