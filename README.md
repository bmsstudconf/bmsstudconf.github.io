# bmsstudconf.github.io
Webpage that hosts the BMS Student conference.

# Website structure
There is a main page (`index.html` and a copy `mobile.html` for mobile browsing) from which there are links to the websites of the different student conferences throughout the year (each has its own folder). Each year has what this document refers to as _home pages_ `[YEAR]/index.html` and `[YEAR]/mobile.html`. Currently both kinds of `index.html` redirect to the appropriate `mobile.html`.

# What to update?
The following things need to be updated each year. Those marked with a _(!)_ will still have to be updated this year before the conference starts as well.
## Year and number of the conference
- *In copyright notices.* On the main pages (`index.html`, `mobile.html`), and at the bottom of all pages of the _new_ `html`s. Make sure to update the number of the student conference as well (12th, 13th, etc)!
- *In `<meta name="author" content="...` tags at the beginning of each new `html`.*
- *In `<meta name="description" content= "...` tags at the beginning of `[YEAR]/index.html` and `[YEAR]/mobile.html`.* Make sure to update the date as well!
- *In the tab-name title text.* On the home pages (`[YEAR]/index.html`, `[YEAR]/mobile.html`) update the `<title>` tag.
- *In the on-site title text.* On the home pages (`[YEAR]/index.html`, `[YEAR]/mobile.html`) update the number and the date of the conference. For `[YEAR]/index.html` also remember to update the `<meta itemprop="startDate" content="...` and `<meta itemprop="endDate" content="...` tags.
- *In the main description of the conference.* On the home pages (`[YEAR]/index.html`, `[YEAR]/mobile.html`), just under the on-site title.

## Structural elements
- *Link to the new conference's website.* On the main pages (`index.html`, `mobile.html`) add a link to the current conference's website to the dropdown menu.
- *Links in the navigation bar on each new `html`.* This is only relevant if you want to add a new page to the navbar - it has to be added in each `html`!

## Blocks of text 
- (!) *Short summaries on the home page.* Currently these include some updates, schedule, venue, poster, organizers, and the pictures.
- (!) *Short introduction of the invited speakers.* Make sure to ask for their consent before making these public!
- (!) *Title, description of social event.*
- (!) *Schedule.*
- (!) *Name precise room of the conference.* Make sure to also update the "how to get here" part with possible reconstruction infos, and check if the named cafeterias are indeed open and priced as claimed.
- (!) *Description of Wine and Cheese.*
- *List of organizers.*

## Other
- (!) *Add registration link.* Make sure to announce the opening and closing of the registration in the "updates" section(s).
- (!) *Add poster.* Take a smaller screenshot of it so the preview can load fast. Should be made available on `poster.html` and on the home pages.
